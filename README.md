🟢 Matrix-Themed C Code Playground

A simple interactive webpage with a Matrix-style animated background that showcases C programming concepts, where users can directly run the code using an online compiler link.

This project was built as part of my learning journey while exploring how programming and basic web development can work together.

✨ Features

Matrix-style animated background for a cool visual experience

Displays C language code examples

Each example includes a direct link to an online compiler

Simple and clean layout using HTML & CSS

🛠️ Tech Stack

HTML – structure of the webpage

CSS – styling and Matrix background effect

C – code examples showcased on the page

Online Compiler – to run the code instantly

📚 What I Learned

How to structure a basic webpage using HTML

Styling and animations using CSS

Integrating external tools (online compiler) with a webpage

Improving understanding of C programming concepts through presentation and interaction

I also used AI tools to assist during development, while focusing on understanding, modifying, and learning from the implementation.
